## Introduction

The **Web-Based Heart Failure Prediction System** is designed to predict the possibility of heart failure in individuals based on various health parameters. Heart failure is a common and life-threatening condition, often diagnosed too late. Our platform leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide early warnings, allowing patients to take preventive measures or seek timely medical intervention.

The system employs **Machine Learning** algorithms, specifically the **Regression** models, to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart failure. By identifying high-risk individuals, our tool aims to reduce the rate of fatal heart events like heart attacks, giving patients a chance to make lifestyle adjustments or receive preventive treatments.

### Key Objectives:
- **Early Detection**: To help patients identify potential heart issues before they escalate.
- **Preventive Action**: Provide recommendations based on predictions for lifestyle and treatment changes.
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous updates and monitoring to keep patients informed of their heart health.
